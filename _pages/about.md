I’m a PhD student in Computer Science & Engineering at UC San Diego advised by Nadir Weibel. My research interests lie at the intersection of human-computer interaction, machine learning, & reinforcement learning. I’m interested in leveraging social signal as rewards to improve machine learning systems using varying modalities. I’m also interested in XAI and the personalization of conversational agents. 

If you are interested in my work, feel free to reach out! I’m also happy to talk or collaborate on new projects.

Aside from conducting research, you can find me and my <a href="https://imgur.com/a/i9Ivp6w">dog</a> at your local matcha & tea shop.
