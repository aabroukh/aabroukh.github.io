My research interests lie broadly in reinforcement learning & interpretability. Specifically, I'm interested in providing embodied agents with common sense priors to better develop world models. For interpretability, I aim to make machine learning systems more interpretable for everyday users to inform better decision making. I've also worked on projects related to privacy interdependence & community based content moderation.

Aside from conducting research, you can find me and my <a href="https://imgur.com/a/i9Ivp6w">dog</a> at your local matcha & tea shop.
