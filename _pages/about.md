I’m a 4th year PhD student in Computer Science & Engineering at UC San Diego advised by Nadir Weibel. My research interests lie at the intersection of reinforcement learning, social signals, and mental health. Specifically, I work on finetuning conversational audio system and the application of preference learning frameworks to the audio domain.

If you are interested in my work, feel free to reach out. I’m always happy to talk or collaborate on new projects!

Aside from conducting research, you can find me and my <a href="https://imgur.com/a/i9Ivp6w">dog</a> at your local matcha & tea shop. My favorite is <a href="https://paruteabar.com/">Paru</a> .
